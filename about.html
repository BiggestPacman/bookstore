<b> BOOK STORE HISTORY</b> <br>
<br>The Peters family bookstore was co-founded by the trio of Peter dominic, Peter jesse. Yes, we are a family-owned business. From the dining room of our Lagos mainland flat in 2015, we have built The Peters family bookstore into one of the most recognizable brands in the Nigerian book industry and we are just getting started.
Through a strong combination of online shopping via our website and social media handles (Twitter Instagram ), Whatsapp and a warm and robust in-store experience, we offer readers of all genres, original books at the best price points.
We believe in the power of books to take you everywhere and our deep love for books and the community that they foster drive us to curate literary experiences for our customers. We are passionate about the books that we stock and are deeply interested in our customers.
We are a huge supporter of local publishing scene, and we are even more partial to self-published authors. We are proudly Nigerian and are committed to fostering a thriving book culture in our community. <br> <br>


<b> MISSION</b> <br>
<br>Every year around this time, I take a moment to reflect on the progress I have made as a writer within the past twelve months. I reflect on whether or not I have reached my writerly goals for that year. I evaluate the areas that I could have improved and what I could have approached differently. Then, based on this, I establish new goals for the upcoming year. <br>
In all that I write—both fiction and non-fiction—I hope to minister the healing power of God’s love, show readers that hope is always available, and leave them with an appetite to pursue a purposeful Life <br><br>
